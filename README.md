# Task list

## Features
- Loads a list of tasks from a JSON file
- Saves task progress
- Specific Task types which have their own requirements
  - All level requirements: e.g. Get level 10 in all skills
  - All skill xp: e.g. Get 10M xp in all skills
  - Any skill level: e.g. Get level 10 in any skill
  - Any skill xp: e.g. Get 10M xp in any skill
  - Combat level: e.g. Get 120 combat
  - Equipment: e.g. Equip a full set of rune, barrows... you name it
  - Quest point: e.g. Get 200 quest points
  - Quest: e.g. Complete the Children of the Sun
  - Skill level: e.g. Get 99 attack
  - Skill xp: e.g. Get 10M attack xp
  - Total level: e.g. Get 2000 total
  - Total xp: e.g. Get 250M total xp
  - Prayer: e.g. Activate the Piety prayer
  - ...
- Notifies you when you complete a task


## TODO's
- Add custom panel to display tasks, total points, ...
- Ability to patch the loaded task list with the default task list, so newer tasks can be added later on.
- For all skill level tasks ignore hitpoints if <= 10 (so tasks like get level 5 in any skill will actually trigger)
